Private DNS Quick Setting - toggle and configure your Private DNS settings on Android 9+ from the comfort of your quick settings panel.

This is a fork of flashsphere/private-dns-qs with modifications to remove the unnecessary launcher icon and improve overall usability.

In order to change the Private DNS settings, this app requires the
`WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission.

This permission can only be granted in an ADB shell with the command:
```
pm grant com.flashsphere.privatednsqs android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```
Check out https://private-dns-qs.web.app/help on how to use `adb` to grant the permission.
