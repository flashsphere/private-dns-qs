Configure your preferred DNS modes to toggle in app and toggle your Private DNS mode from your quick settings panel.

In order to change the Private DNS setting, this app requires the `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission.

This permission can only be granted either by Shizuku or in an ADB shell.

- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/download/)

    [Start Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/#start-shizuku), then open this app, and the permission should be granted automatically.

- ADB

    Use the command: `adb shell pm grant com.flashsphere.privatednsqs android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`

    Check out [private-dns-qs.web.app/help](https://private-dns-qs.web.app/help) on the steps to use adb to grant the permission.
